# QCD @ FCCee
This repo tracks the progress of my research project studying QCD physics in 500 GeV electron-positron collisions in the FCCee. The analyses are mainly in C++ using the Pythia 8.312, ROOT 6.32.08, and FastJet 3.4.3 frameworks. Other studies include: partonic jet contributions in LHC hadron collisions, and scaling factors for comparing e<sup>+</sup>e/p+p+/e-p+ colliders.
