# QCD @ FCCee
This repo tracks the progress of my research project studying QCD physics in 500 GeV electron-positron collisions in the FCCee. The analyses are mainly in C++ using the Pythia 8.312, ROOT 6.32.08, and FastJet 3.4.3 frameworks. Some side studies include: partonic jet contributions in LHC hadron collisions in the LHC, and scaling factors for comparing e+e-/p+p+/e-p+ colliders.
